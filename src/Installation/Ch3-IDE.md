# IDEs to use for python

1) VSCODE
-Easy and lightweight
-You just need to install the python extention in the extentions market
-The extentions you need to download are:
    -Python
    -Python for VSCode

2) Pycharm
-Gives more warning
-Terminal is easier to read (Personally)


Use whichever one you want. They both work well.
