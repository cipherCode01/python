# IDEs/text editors to use for python

## IDE vs text editor
An IDE stands for integreated developement environment. Essentially its a program that "help" you program. It has features such as auto complete and error finding that makes coding easier for you.
It usually allows you to run the script inside the IDE without needing to type a command in the command prompt


A text editor, is well just a text editor. You can get plugins to make it more IDE-like, but the base form of the text editor is no more than just a way to type. You also need to configure the commands to run the script -- unless if you have a plugin.

Here are some of the IDEs/text editors:

### VSCODE
-Easy and lightweight
-You just need to install the python extention in the extentions market
-The extentions you need to download are:
    -Python
    -Python for VSCode

### Pycharm
-Gives more warning
-Terminal is easier to read (Personally)

These are the other IDEs/text editors, but i can't comment on them since I've never used them:
* Spyder
* Kite
* IDLE
* Sublime Text 3
* Atom
* Jupyter
* Pydev
* Thonny


Use whatever IDE/text editor you want, it does not matter at the end of the day.
