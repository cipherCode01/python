Let's talk about the utter basics in Python.

So basic to our program:
```python
print("Hello world")
```
[Go to Real Cool Heading section](The-"print"-function)
# Comments

First part is comments.

Your code basically does the "How" of the program, and your comments explain the "Why" of the program

There are a few ways to leave a comment:

```python
#This is a 1 line comment

#This is a
#2 line comment

"""
These are docstrings
You see how i don't need to put in hashtags
here to make a multiline comment?
Made with triple quotes on both sides of the text
"""
```
Your comments should be as effective and concise as possible- but not so concise that it's impossible to understand


```python
#main.py -> Prints out hello world

print("hello world") #This prints out hello world
```

The comment made in our helloworld.py is simple enough

# The "print" function

The 
```python
print()
```
Function is a very useful function.

Obviously it's used to output text and you'll soon see, numbers.

Its also good for seeing what your program is doing at a certain point. Which we will discuss later on.

Lets test out the limits of print- You copy paste the code into your IDE and test it out, or just read on.


## Case 1: Numbers

Lets do some basic math inside the *print()* function:

```python
print(2+3) # Adding 2 numbers
print(5-2) # Minusing 2 numbers
print( 5 * 2) # * symbol represents multiply, so we are saying 5 multiplied by 2
print(10/5) # / symbol represents division, so we are saying 10 divided by 5
Output:
5
3
10
2
```

So it's obvious that the print function can take some arbiritary math sum and execute it.

### NB
From this point onwards, when i want to refer to text like 
```python 
"Hello world"
```
I will refer to it as a "string".
String is a collection of characters

So "H" = character
but "He" = string

This will be explained in the next section that deals with types
