Lets talk about types and variables

# Variables

A variable is the same thing as a placeholder for some value.

To declare a variable:

```python
x = 5 #Example 1
y = "Hello world" #Example 2

print(x) # Outputs 5
print(y) # Outputs "Hello world"
```

Just put the above code to see for yourself.

Basically the "=" operator tells python that 2 values are equal.

So *x=5* tells python that whereever you see an *x*, put *5*
